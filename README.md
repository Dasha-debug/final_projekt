A cozy web application designed to make breakfast ordering a delightful experience between partners. This project combines functionality with a warm, intimate aesthetic to create a personal breakfast ordering system.

## Project Purpose

The Breakfast Surprise application allows one partner to select breakfast items and send a personalized order to their significant other. It's designed to make morning surprises more special and organized, with a touch of romance.

## Features

- Interactive menu with beautiful food images
- Real-time breakfast selection tracking
- Customizable delivery options
- Personal touches like optional "kiss with breakfast"
- Cozy, warm design inspired by artisanal cafés
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Gmail integration for order delivery

## Technical Implementation

### Files Structure

- `index.html`: The landing page with a welcoming interface
- `menu.html`: Displays the breakfast menu with items in a responsive grid
- `order.html`: Contains the order form with delivery preferences
- `styles.css`: Implements a warm, cozy design system using:
  - Georgia font for elegant typography
  - Warm brown color palette
  - Soft shadows and rounded corners
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
- `script.js`: Handles the application logic including:

### Design Choices

The visual design emphasizes warmth and intimacy through:
- Soft, warm colors (browns, creams)
- Rounded corners and gentle shadows
- Elegant typography
- Subtle animations on interactions

The breakfast selection area features a sticky header for easy access while browsing, with decorative elements inspired by artisanal coffee shops.

### User Flow

2. Selects items which appear in the "Your Breakfast Selection" area
3. Proceeds to order customization
4. Chooses delivery time, location, and special touches

## Technical Challenges

Several design decisions were made to enhance user experience:

- Creating a responsive grid layout for menu items
- Ensuring smooth transitions between states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
